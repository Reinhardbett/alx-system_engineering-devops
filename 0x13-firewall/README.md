## 0x13: Firewall

# Requirements:
- the school network is filtering outgoing connections (via a network-based firewall), so you might not be able to interact with certain ports on servers outside of the school network. To test your work on web-01, please perform the test from outside of the school network, like from your web-02 server. If you SSH into your web-02 server, the traffic will be originating from web-02 and not from the schoolâ€™s network, bypassing the firewall.
- Be very careful with firewall rules! For instance, if you ever deny port 22/TCP and log out of your server, you will not be able to reconnect to your server via SSH, and we will not be able to recover it. When you install UFW, port 22 is blocked by default, so you should unblock it immediately before logging out of your server.
