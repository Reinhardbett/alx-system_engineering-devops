## 0x16. API advanced

- Interviews will commonly ask to write a Python script that queries a given endpoint’, sometimes they require you to use recursive functions and format/sort the results
- The project uses the Reddit API for practice
- Most of the endpoints available do not require any form of authentication, and there’s tons of information to be parsed out and presented.

# Learning goals
- How to read API documentation to find the endpoints you’re looking for
- How to use an API with pagination
- How to parse JSON results from an API
- How to make a recursive API call
- How to sort a dictionary by value

# Requirements for project
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- The first line of all files should be exactly:
```
!/usr/bin/python3
```
- All code should be PEP 8 style compliant
- Only the Requests module will be used for sending HTTP requests to the Reddit API
